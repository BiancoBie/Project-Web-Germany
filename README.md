Hello!

I hope you enjoyed taking a look at the projectme and other 3 colleagues made in our Erasmus+ KA2 experience in the company.
We worked in a company named Alfatraining for 2 weeks, in Karlsruhe, Germany. It was a very nice experience, and we gained knowledge in HTML5, CSS, PHP and Javascript.
In the future I hope to add more details to the project, and make it even more interactive.
You also have a Powerpoint presentation that we made during that time included in the folder, that explains some of the details we added to the web pages.

Thank you for reading this document,
Bianca
